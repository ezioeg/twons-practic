Twons Practic is a technical test for React Native CLI, where you are required to create a design within a 5-day time limit. The project involves building a navigation system between two or more screens. The Home screen should feature an e-commerce clothing store design, including:

- Input fields
- A banner with active dots
- Category scroll
- A sale timer
- A subcategory scroll
- Product listings
- A floating tab bar

Upon clicking a product, users should be navigated to the Product Detail screen, which includes:

- A header with an image and floating buttons
- An image scroll within the header, allowing users to click and set the images as the header image
- Product information
- Product rating (star)
- A scrollable list of sizes
- A color dropdown
- A floating bottom tab bar displaying the price and a purchase button
